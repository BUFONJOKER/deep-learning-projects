# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

Concise, hands‑on deep learning examples in **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
Each folder targets a specific domain and framework.
Projects stay small so you can follow the full flow.
Code emphasizes clarity and reproducibility.
Use this repo as a learning path or quick reference.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The layout separates frameworks and problem domains.
Each domain folder contains related notebooks.
This keeps experiments easy to find and compare.
Follow the tree below to navigate quickly.
Add new work in the matching domain folder.

	ANN/
	Computer-Vision/
	NLP/
Tensorflow/
	ANN/
		01-student-depression-ann.ipynb

	NLP/
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with any notebook that matches your interest.
Run cells from top to bottom to reproduce results.
Use a fresh environment for fewer version issues.
If a dataset is required, the notebook links it.
Save your changes in a new copy if needed.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a notebook under your preferred framework.
3. Run cells in order.

## ✨ Highlights

Each track focuses on a common deep learning use case.
ANN covers tabular baselines and feature learning.
Computer Vision focuses on image understanding.
NLP focuses on text and sequence modeling.
Use these as templates for your own projects.

- **ANN**: Feed‑forward models for tabular data.
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification and vision models.
- **NLP**: Text classification and sequence models.

## ✅ Requirements

You need a recent Python installation to run notebooks.
Install Jupyter or use VS Code’s notebook support.
Install PyTorch or TensorFlow per notebook needs.
Some notebooks may need extra data libraries.
Check the first cells for any additional setup.

- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
- PyTorch and/or TensorFlow (as needed per notebook)

## 📝 Notes

Notebooks are grouped by framework and task.
Most datasets are linked directly in the notebook.
Outputs may differ slightly across environments.
Set random seeds for more consistent results.
Open issues if you spot broken links or typos.

- Notebooks are grouped by framework and domain.
- Dataset links are provided inside notebooks.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

Planned work focuses on usability and coverage.
Scripts will mirror notebooks for automation.
Evaluation dashboards will summarize performance.
More advanced architectures are on the list.
Suggestions are welcome via issues or PRs.

- Add training scripts to mirror notebooks
- Add evaluation dashboards
- Add advanced architectures (Transformers, ViTs)
