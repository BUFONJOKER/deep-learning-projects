```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open any notebook under the framework of your choice.
3. Run cells sequentially in Jupyter/VS Code.

## Highlights

- **ANN**: Classic feed‑forward models for tabular data.
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification and vision architectures.
- **NLP**: Text classification and sequence models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
- PyTorch and/or TensorFlow (as needed per notebook)

## Notes

- Notebooks are organized by framework and domain.
- Datasets are referenced within notebooks; download links are included where applicable.

## Roadmap

- Add training scripts for notebook parity
- Add model evaluation dashboards
- Add more advanced architectures (Transformers, ViTs)
