# ⚙️ TensorFlow ANN

## 📌 Overview

Focused TensorFlow ANN examples for classification, easy to run and tweak.
Use them as baselines for tabular prediction tasks.
Architectures are simple and intentionally readable.
You can swap features or add layers quickly.
Ideal for learning end‑to‑end ANN workflow.

## 📦 Contents

Each notebook is a self‑contained experiment.
Names describe the problem and model type.
Open the notebook to see data sources and steps.
Outputs include metrics and visual checks.
Add new notebooks following the same naming style.
- **01-student-depression-ann.ipynb**: ANN model for student depression classification.

## 🚀 Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
Run cells from top to bottom to reproduce results.
Use a fresh environment to reduce version conflicts.
If a dataset is required, follow the link provided.
Save your own experiments in a new copy.

## ✅ Requirements

You need a recent Python installation and TensorFlow.
Jupyter or VS Code notebooks are required to run cells.
Additional libraries may be imported in the first cells.
Install dependencies before running training steps.
GPU support is optional but can speed up training.
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
